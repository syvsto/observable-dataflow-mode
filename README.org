#+TITLE: Observable Dataflow Mode

** What's this?

   This is a major mode for Emacs to provide support for ~.ojs~ files
   used by [[https://github.com/asg017/dataflow][Dataflow]], a CLI tool that supports working with Observable
   notebooks locally.

   The major mode depends on Dataflow being installed.

   *Warning:* Currently only provides a couple of commands for
   handling a Dataflow development server, and enables Javascript
   syntax highlighting.
